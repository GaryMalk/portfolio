        <h1>Education Biography</h1>

        <section class="grid1">
            <div class="box">
                <h2>Career Path Prior to Entering MAT Program</h2>
                <p>I worked in the software development industry for 26 years prior to entering the MAT program at CWU.
                    I started as a manual tester hired as a contractor to work at Microsoft to test localized software
                    on the Pan-Euro version of Windows 98, due to my fluency in Romanian and ability to speak and read
                    German. My fluency in Romanian came about because I did humanitarian aid work in Romania for six
                    years.</p>
                <p>I progressed into test lead and test manager roles, learning how to write code for test automation
                    and test tools, and eventually transitioned into software developer in test (SDET) roles. My last
                    software industry position was Principal SDET at Puget Sound Energy.</p>
                <h2>What Led Me to Pursue Teaching</h2>
                <p>Most of my training has been on-the-job. In 2018, I decided to go back to school and earn a
                    Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This was after 20 years in the industry in senior development
                    roles. I was able to accelerate and graduate in 2020 from Western Governors University (WGU). A lot
                    had changed in higher education since I had been in school 40 years prior. I was inspired by the
                    competency-based learning at WGU. Classes are 100% online, at your own pace. I had a required
                    weekly phone call with my program mentor to verify I was staying on track. Classes are pass/fail and
                    passing is considered at least 3.0.</p>
                <p>This is revolutionary. What matters in competency-based learning is what you learned by the end of
                    the process, not how well you performed while you were learning. Failing an exam at a traditional
                    school
                    means taking the whole class over again, wasting weeks on the sections you already know. In
                    competency-based learning, you only study the parts you didn’t do well on and take the test again.
                    Self-paced is good both for the highly capable who can accelerate and those needing extra help. More
                    to the point, each individual can accelerate through sections that come easily or are already known
                    and
                    slow down for sections that are more difficult. Competency-based learning is at once democratizing,
                    equitable, and accommodating.</p>
                <p>I became intrigued with how my own early educational career might have been different. As I studied
                    more, I learned that colleges and high schools are adopting competency-based learning along with
                    “flipped classrooms”, where the students watch recorded lectures at home and come to class to get
                    help with assignments. The instructor role transforms into tutor and curator.
                <p>More and more, I thought about this being the next act in my life. I’ve had my career. I could now
                    teach and call it retirement. I wanted to be part of what’s changing in education.</p>
                <h2>My Academic Background</h2>
                <p>I studied Physics and Psychology at the University of Washington after high school. I also had
                    extensive coursework in Mathematics and Chemistry.</p>
                <p>While working humanitarian aid overseas, I studied the Management of Voluntary and Non-Profit
                    Organizations through distance learning with Open University in the U.K., completing one year for a
                    Certificate of Management.</p>
                <p>I am largely self-taught in building computers and computer programming, as mentioned above. I
                    obtained the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) and Microsoft Certified Systems
                    Administrator (MCSA) for Windows 2000 and became proficient in QA and C# while working in the
                    industry. I later obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from WGU, as mentioned above.
                </p>

                <h2>Professional Training</h2>
                <p>The most significant training I’ve enrolled in as an educator is the Masters of Arts in Teaching
                    (MAT) with Central Washington University, starting June 2024, with a teaching certificate endorsed
                    in
                    Computer Science and Mathematics anticipated in June 2025 and the masters completion anticipated in
                    August
                    2025.
                </p>
                <p>In July 2024, I attended a week-long seminar for Computer Science professors held by the National IT
                    Innovation Center (NITIC), called Summer Working Connections. I was enrolled in the Cyber Buffet
                    track, which was training in teaching Cyber Security topics.</p>
                <p>In August 2024, I attended a one-evening training in pedagogy held by Northwest University for its
                    faculty.</p>
                <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
                <p>I’m currently adjunct faculty at Lake Washington Institute of Technology, where I have taught since
                    April 2024. I teach classes in Java, Python, Html with CSS, and Data Structures and Algorithms.
                    For Fall Semester 2024, I also taught as adjunct Professional Software Engineering at Northwest
                    University, a class I developed for them based on my industry experience.</p>
