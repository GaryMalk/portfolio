            <blockquote class="italics">The teacher works with others to create environments that support individual
                and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in
                learning, and self motivation.</blockquote>

            <p>This standard is about building an environment that is conducive to learning. I set expectations high but
                take steps to help students feel safe. Starting a semester with a fun icebreaker is one such strategy.
                Working together collaboratively also leads to students feeling less isolated and able to learn from
                each other. Students with learning differences get the support they need.</p>
            <p>We also help each other feel safe by setting a ground rule that all interactions are respectful. I never
                had to issue more than a verbal correction for disrespectful speech during my internship, but if needed
                I could escalate to detention or support from the student’s counselor.</p>
            <p>A couple times I did need to have the conversation that just because your friend says he’s “okay with it”
                doesn’t make it okay. He doesn’t want to lose your friendship. What kind of friend are you to put him in
                that position?</p>
            <p>The artifacts below show some other ways I worked to build a safe, supportive learning environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Human Bingo" Icebreaker for the first day of Personal Finance class. There were two versions of
                    the Bingo form, passed out randomly to the students. Students went around talking to each other
                    to collect signatures on their form. This icebreaker idea was shamelessly stolen from our own
                    cohort icebreaker last summer.</li>
                <li>History of Computer Science discussion questions. Students counted off into four groups by
                    powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16 - hey, it's computer science class). Groups met after a PowerPoint
                    presentation to discuss their answers. An example of things overheard from the groups: "I didn't
                    know that almost all programmers used to be women, and now we're in the minority." Artifacts are
                    three example student submissions.</li>
                <li>Personal Finance class: Paying for College Unit: lesson on FAFSA: "ANALYZE: A FAFSA Submission
                    Summary" assignment made available in English and Spanish. A sizeable number of the students in
                    that class were Hispanic.</li>
                <li>Team Assignments spreadsheet for the Microsoft sponsored “Hunt the Wumpus” competition: students
                    were assigned into teams to work together to create their group's version of the "Hunt the Wumpus"
                    game. Each student had an assigned component and their code had to work together, just like a real
                    dev team. Microsoft volunteer advisors came two days a week to explain the requirements and assist
                    the students.
