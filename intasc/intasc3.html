        <h1 class="intasc">InTASC Standard #3<br>Learning Environments</h1>
        <div class="box intasc">
            <blockquote class="italics">The teacher works with others to create environments that support individual
                and
                collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in
                learning,
                and self motivation.</blockquote>

            <p>This standard is about building an environment that is conducive to learning. Expectations are high.
                Students feel safe; students work together collaboratively and the interactions are respectful.
                Students with learning differences get the support they need.</p>
            <p>The artifacts below are some of the ways in which I met this standard:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Human Bingo" Icebreaker for the first day of Personal Finance class. There were two versions of
                    the Bingo form, passed out randomly to the students. Students went around talking to each other
                    to collect signatures on their form. This icebreaker idea was shamelessly stolen from our own
                    cohort icebreaker last summer.</li>
                <li>History of Computer Science discussion questions. Students counted off into four groups by
                    powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16 - hey, it's computer science class). Groups met after a PowerPoint
                    presentation to discuss their answers. An example of things overheard from the groups: "I didn't
                    know that almost all programmers used to be women, and now we're in the minority." Artifacts are
                    three example student submissions.</li>
                <li>Personal Finance class: Paying for College Unit: lesson on FAFSA: "ANALYZE: A FAFSA Submission
                    Summary" assignment made available in English and Spanish. A sizeable number of the students in
                    that class were Hispanic.</li>
                <li>Hunt the Wumpus Group Assignments spreadsheet. Students worked together to create their group's
                    version of the "Hunt the Wumpus" game as part of a competition sponsored by Microsoft. Microsoft
                    volunteer advisors came two days a week to explain the requirements and assist the students.
                </li>
            </ul>
