            <blockquote class="italics">The candidate plans instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous
                learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and
                pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context.</blockquote>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I plan for instruction by considering where we are in the flow of the unit and the course. What
                background knowledge do we build on from the previous lessons or prerequisite knowledge? What
                remedial steps will the learner and I take if that knowledge is missing, rusty, or not fully
                mastered? What are the key learning objectives needed for the upcoming material?</p>
            <p>Opening class with a "Do Now" assignment has proved valuable. It is a short, open book, open note,
                open internet low-stakes quiz on material&nbsp;<em>I haven't lectured on yet</em>. This delivers the
                messages that from the moment we enter the classroom, we are in a learning space and that students
                are expected to read the textbook first in preparation. They have the chance to correct their
                answers, so it's not devastating if they haven't. It also gets their minds engaged on the topic from
                the moment we start, so they are not just lecture spectators.</p>
            <p>On the first day of some classes, the "Do Now" will be what I call the anthropological part of
                learning any subject, the "History of..." part. I want students to grasp their place in history and
                to make a commitment to themselves about how much time they are going to devote to this course.</p>
            <p>A lecture with presentation graphics typically begins with review, going over the main points of the
                previous lesson. I'll often do this by asking questions to allow the students to state the points. If
                this class is the second or later in a series of classes, then at least one day of the first week will
                be spent going through prerequisite lessons at an accellerated rate. I will use the "Fist of Five" or
                similar technique to see how confident students are. The plan for the day may change dramatically, if
                needed.</p>
            <p>For coding classes, the lecture usually concludes with a coding demonstration. The code I write is
                similar to what is required for the assignment, or contains chunks of code that can be copied so it
                is useful for scaffolding.</p>
            <p>During the lab portion, I go around the room and check how students are doing and answer questions. I
                make sure I spend some time sitting with any students with cognitive issues, assisting them with
                scaffolding and additional instruction.</p>
            <p>When there is not a coding assignment or if it's not a coding class, there is often an Exit Ticket
                for students to demonstrate they understood the key concepts and give them a chance for reflection.

                <h2>Finance Class Artifacts</h2>
                <p>In Personal Finance, I was the teacher of record for these units:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buying a Car</li>
                    <li>Paying for College</li>
                    <li>Alternatives to 4-year College</li>
                    <li>Budgeting</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The artifact is a listing from Schoology of all the lessons in those units. While most of the
                    curriculum was from <a href="https://www.ngpf.org/courses/full-year-course/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NextGen
                        Personal Finance</a>, several lessons in the Paying for College unit were my own based on my own
                    research and experience as a dad. Those lessons were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Deep Dive: Deciding Where to Go to School</li>
                    <li>Choice Projects</li>
                    <li>Deep Dive: Savings Plans and Scholarships</li>
                </ul>
