            <p>There are many forms of leadership. Leadership is thinking beyond yourself to what is good for the your
                school and community. Having a vision for where you want to go, planning how to get there, and inspiring
                others to join you is clearly leadership, and we think of such people as charasmatic. But there are
                other types of leaders, and here's the key: leadership can be distributed. Some provide vital expertise
                and services. Some act in an advisory capacity, stepping back giving perspective. Even just showing up
                faithfully is leadership, because without a cadre of reliable, supportive volunteers every organization
                would fail.</p>

                <h2>Hunt the Wumpus</h2>
                <p>Spring quarter the students in my C# classes were assigned into development teams to create a
                    computer game for the &ldquo;Hunt the Wumpus&rdquo; competition sponsored by Microsoft. The students
                    were assigned areas of code to create, such as cave system, score board, player, and movement. They
                    had to learn to work together to make it happen, with me, my mentor, and the Microsoft volunteers
                    who came twice a week acting as advisors.</p>
                <p>I taught the students about source control, how to create a code repository on GitHub, and how to
                    merge code so that multiple developers can work together in the same repository. I gave advice,
                    montiored progress, and helped to debug and sometimes detangle failed merges. The students were
                    required to add me as a collaborator on their repositories. Artifacts presented are the assignment
                    in Schoology requiring students to do this, a screenshot of an email inviting me to collaborate, and
                    a screenshot of a GitHub repository.</p>
                <p>On the big day we took the two classes to Microsoft for the judging competition with several other
                    schools competing. Three of our eight teams brought home trophies, one of which is also presented as
                    an artifact.</p>

                <h3>Cross-Discipline Instruction</h2>
                    <p>As a college student, I always enjoyed the way history was interwoven into my science and
                        mathematics classes. I teach my computer science classes that way, too, because it's important
                        for students to understand their place in history, where it started, and where it's going.
                        Presented as an artifact is the PowerPoint of The History of Computer Science, which is my
                        favorite lecture to deliver.
                    </p>
                    <p>This last year I also taught Personal Finance, including a unit on Paying for College. One of the
                        lessons I developed was on winning scholarships, with an assigned scholarship essay. Teaching
                        how to write an essay was language arts. Students were taught that the elements of a winning
                        scholarhip essay are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Core Values</li>
                        <li>Insights</li>
                        <li>Vulnerability</li>
                        <li>Craft</li>
                        <li>A tie-in to your educational and career goals</li>
                        <li>How you will give back</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As an example, I present from the Assessment page a scholarhip rough draft written by one of my
                        students, the feedback I gave him, and his final draft: <a
                            href="intasc6.html#scholarship">Scholarship Essay</a></p>

                <h2>Toastmasters Club</h2>
                <p>I've been a Toastmaster for five years. I've been an officer in multiple roles, including club
                    president and area director. As an area director, I visited the clubs assigned to me and worked with
                    them to acheive success. We were awarded President's Distinguished Area, the only area in the
                    district to acheive that status. My artifact is a screenshot of the email from our district director
                    notifying me of this.</p>
                <p>The computer science curriculum in most colleges focuses on technical skills, yet communication and
                    leadership skills are critical in every career. Toastmasters can bridge that gap. While one must be
                    over 18 to be a member of Toastmasters, high school students can participate in the Youth Leadership
                    Program. It is my desire to sponsor one at my school.</p>

                <h2>PTA Membership</h2>
                <p>As a dad, I've been a member of the PTA, regularly attending meetings and volunteering. I've been a
                    field trip chaperone, volunteered in a classroom for a day, and helped with field day. Because of my
                    past advocacy for foster kids, I had experience working with the legislature so I was Legislative
                    Liason two years in a row and organized kids to come to Olympia on PTA Lobby Day (usually on MLK
                    Day). I plan to suport the PTA as a teacher as well. My artifact is a photo of my D.O.G.S. (Dads of
                    Great Students) t-shirt, worn while volunteering.</p>

                <h2>Community Leadership</h2>
                <p>I have been a foster/adopt dad and advocated for foster kids, testifying in Olympia and working
                    toward the passage of foster care reforms. I'm a member of my church's charity committee, and have
                    organized or assisted in multiple programs, including food drives for the Woodinville Storehouse
                    food bank and toiletries drives for the homeless women and their families who live in "Safe Parking"
                    at a local church. Many years ago, I was humanitarian aid director for a grass-roots organization,
                    living in Romania and coordinating delivery of aid and supervising volunteers at Romanian
                    orphanages.</p>
