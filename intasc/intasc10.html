            <blockquote class="italics">The candidate seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take
                responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school
                professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession.

            <p>There are many forms of leadership. Leadership is thinking beyond yourself to what is good for the your
                school and community. Having a vision for where you want to go, planning how to get there, and inspiring
                others to join you is clearly leadership, and we think of such people as charasmatic. But there are
                other types of leaders, and here's the key: leadership can be distributed. Some provide vital expertise
                and services. Some act in an advisory capacity, stepping back giving perspective. Even just showing up
                faithfully is leadership, because without a cadre of reliable, supportive volunteers every non-profit
                organization would fail.</p>
            <p>Standard #10 is also about collaboration with students and cross-discipline with colleagues. There are
                many natural connections that add interest and make the learner's education more well-rounded.</p>

                <h2>Hunt the Wumpus</h2>
                <p>Spring quarter the students in my C# classes were assigned into development teams to create a
                    computer game for the &ldquo;Hunt the Wumpus&rdquo; competition sponsored by Microsoft. The students
                    were assigned areas of code to create, such as cave system, score board, player, and movement. They
                    had to learn to work together to make it happen, with me, my mentor, and the Microsoft volunteers
                    who came twice a week acting as advisors.</p>
                <p>I taught the students about source control, how to create a code repository on GitHub, and how to
                    merge code so that multiple developers can work together in the same repository. I gave advice,
                    montiored progress, and helped to debug and sometimes detangle failed merges. Students were
                    required to add me as a repository collaborator.</p>
                <p>On the big day we took our classes to Microsoft for the judging competition with several other
                    schools competing. Three of our eight teams brought home trophies, one of which is also presented as
                    an artifact. Other artifacts presented are a screenshot of a GitHub repository and a collaboration
                    invite.</p>

                <h3>Social Studies</h3>
                <p>History of Computer Science PowerPoint presentation: I give this lecture on the first day of all
                    my computer science classes (HTML, C#, Java, Algorithms) because it is important for students to
                    understand where we are in history, the contributions of the pioneers, and what new challenges
                    their generation will work on. It's also important to see no matter who you are that important
                    contributions were made by people who look like you.</p>

                <h4>Scholarship Essay</h4>
                <p>This last year I also taught Personal Finance, including a unit on Paying for College. One of the
                    lessons I developed was on winning scholarships, with an assigned scholarship essay. Students were
                    taught that the elements of a winning scholarhip essay are:</p>

                <div class="grid2">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Core Values</li>
                        <li>Personal Insights</li>
                        <li>Vulnerability</li>
                        <li>Craft</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A tie-in to your educational and career goals</li>
                        <li>How you plan to use your education to give back</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>As an example, I present from the Assessment page a scholarship rough draft written by one of my
                    students, the feedback I gave him, and his final draft: <a
                        href="intasc6.html#scholarship">Scholarship Essay</a></p>
                <h4>Reading and Diversity</h4>
                <p>For my Children’s Literature class this summer, we created posters to promote diversity in reading,
                    keeping in mind our school’s demographics and the interests of our students. At my host school,
                    Asians are the largest minority group at 20%; in my Computer Science classes it’s over to 50%. My CS
                    students are naturally interested in science and science fiction so my theme was Exploration with
                    motifs of space, the oceans, and computers. The resources represented include graphic novels,
                    chapter books, fiction and non-fiction, photo essay books, magazines, and websites. These posters
                    would be of interest to my students, promote reading, and not look at all out of place in a computer
                    science classroom.</p>

                <h2>Toastmasters Club</h2>
                <p>I've been a Toastmaster for five years. I've been an officer in multiple roles, including club
                    president and area director. As an area director, I visited the clubs assigned to me and worked with
                    them to acheive success. We were awarded President's Distinguished Area, which is the highest level
                    award. We were the only area in the district to acheive that status. My artifact is a screenshot of
                    the notification email from our district director.</p>
                <p>The computer science curriculum in most colleges focuses on technical skills, yet communication and
                    leadership skills are critical in every career. Toastmasters can bridge that gap. While one must be
                    over 18 to be a member of Toastmasters, high school students can participate in the Youth Leadership
                    Program. It is my desire to sponsor one at my school.</p>

                        a field trip chaperone, volunteered in a classroom for a day, and helped with field day. Because
                        of my past advocacy for foster kids, I had experience working with the legislature so I was
                        Legislative Liason two years in a row and organized kids to come to Olympia on PTA Lobby Day
                        (usually on MLK Day). I plan to suport the PTA as a teacher as well. My artifact is a photo of
                        my Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) t-shirt, worn while volunteering.</p>
