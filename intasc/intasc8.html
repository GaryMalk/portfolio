            <blockquote class="italics">The candidate understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to
                encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build
                skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways.</blockquote>

            <p>The objective in computer programming classes is to teach students how to write code, so coding
                demonstrations and coding assignments will always be high on the list of strategies. But there are many
                strategies I use to transmit a concept and many modalities of giving instruction.</p>
            <p>My classes have assigned reading and assigned videos. I use short, easy-to-understand videos that
                highlight the concept without getting too deep into implementation details so I recommend students start
                there. I present an example video from YouTube as an artifact.</p>
            <p>I do enjoy doing stand-up lectures with presentation graphics. Done right, presentations should include
                plenty of colorful graphics and animation. They should not be "walls of words". The text should be
                mostly bullet points. Students know how to read and don't need me to read a presentation to them. With
                or without presentation graphics, during the lecture I take a formative assessment, such as asking for a
                "Fist of Five" or taking a "Mud Check", after each key idea as discussed. My artifact of this is the
                Intro to Algorithms presentation.</p>
            <p>Coding assignments can also be fun. The artifact Palindrome Detection assignment is both fun and
                humorous, and it teaches students a bit about history, too.</p>
            <p>But my favorite prop is my set of number cards. The cards are simply thick posterboard from the dollar
                store cut into quarters. On one side, a number is written in black. On the other side, binary numbers
                "1" or "0" are written in red. I use the red side to teach binary number conversion and the black side
                to teach sorting algorithms and hash table algorithms. The lesson plans for binary numbers and sorting
                are presented below, as are photos of the cards and of students holding them.</p>
            <p>For binary numbers, I divide the class into two teams, and each team sends up four students per turn.
                Each student gets a "0" card and a "1" card, one of which they should choose to hold up, and the
                students stand in a row. I give them a decimal number and we see which team can convert it to binary
                first. Some students catch on sooner, but that's great because they help their teammates know which
                number they should be holding. After several iterations, a winning side is declared (actually, it was a
                tie!) and then we have the "all-star round". Both teams pick their top four players, but now instead of
                competing to convert 4-bit numbers, they are cooperating to convert a combined 8-bit number.</p>
            <p>Similarly, for sorting I have the students stand in a row with the cards in random order. After learning
                about a sorting algorithm, they have to sort themselves using that algorithm. It's a fun way to
                physically understand how the sorting algorithms work.</p>
