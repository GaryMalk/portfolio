            <p>High School students come to computer programming classes with different levels of programming,
                motivations, and learning rates. Along with theory, demonstrations, and coding assignments I provide
                mentoring, feedback, and significant scaffolding as needed. Some only need coding
                opportunity while others struggle and need a lot of personal attention.</p>

                <h2>Scaffolding Computer Science</h2>
                <p>Computer Science – Programming in C# was an introductory computer programming class for many
                    students. The students had varying levels of background. Half the class was designated Highly
                    Capable; many of those had previous coding experience and many were driven to learn. Many had
                    no coding experience and needed extra help. Two had cognitive difficulties and needed scaffolding.
                </p>
                <p>To begin a unit, I did a code-along demonstration of a particular concept or set of concepts.
                    Students could observe the code displayed on screen as I wrote it and were invited to “code along”.
                    I went slowly, talking about the concept as I did, and allowing the class to direct me as to whether
                    they needed time to catch up. After completion, the demo code I wrote would be made available to the
                    students, as well as the code they were expected to have written with me. They were then given an
                    assignment that was similar to the demo but different enough to require them to apply the concepts
                    to a new context.</p>
                <p>While the students worked on their assignment, I made the rounds, paying special attention to the
                    students who normally needed help, but also checking in with the others and being open to questions.
                </p>
                <p>Students were also encouraged to help each other, and several students had “go-to” people they went
                    to for help.</p>
                <p>For the students who had cognitive difficulties, I would pull up a chair and talk them through the
                    assignment. Usually the demo code was close enough for them to copy/paste or to follow the pattern
                    for the new context. I would sometimes spend 20-25% of the assignment time with them, but it was
                    also surprising to me how much they could accomplish on their own.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I wish I had put more comments in my code while I was writing it to serve as
                    directions for students. That would have encouraged them to enter such comments in their code as
                    they coded along, which would help them completing their assignment. It is also a good habit to
                    develop in general.</p>

                    <h2>Adding Challenge</h2>
                    <p>A significant number of students in my programming classes were highly capable and highly
                        motivated. The goal was to keep their interest and provide challenging learning opportunities
                        while not overwhelming those who need more help.</p>
                    <p>My solution was to begin each lesson simply with what the students already knew, adding more to
                        it until we reached the learning objectives. I taught theory first but then moved right into
                        demonstrating how to write the code. The students who needed minimal instruction could jump
                        right into doing the assignment without waiting for me to finish the lesson. While I was doing
                        this, I threw out teasers by mentioning a coding technique that would solve a more complex
                        problem that I could show them “later”, just to pique interest. Then as I did my rounds I would
                        stop at the desks of hi-cap students and say, “hey, want to see something?” and show them the
                        more advanced technique.</p>
                    <p>But these extra lessons were not only offered to the students designated hi-cap. Often, while
                        working 1:1 with a struggling student, if things were connecting for them then along with my 1:1
                        recitation of the theory I’d elaborate a bit more and show them the technique, too. This made
                        them feel special, recipients of the secret knowledge. Other students weren’t ready for it or
                        not interested, and that was fine because it wasn’t required for the assignment.</p>
                    <p>Another strategy was to add a “Challenge” problem to an assignment. It wasn’t required, but it
                        could earn extra points.</p>
