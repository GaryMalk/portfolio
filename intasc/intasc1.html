            <p>High School students come to computer programming classes with different levels of programming,
                motivations, and learning rates. Along with theory, demonstrations, and coding assignments I provide
                mentoring, feedback, and significant scaffolding as needed. Some only need coding
                opportunity while others struggle and need a lot of personal attention.</p>

            <p>Being sensitive to learner differences also encourages learner development. Students are more motivated
                to learn when assignments are contextualized and it leverages their strengths to increase their
                learning, as demonstrated by my Music Man story.</p>

                    <h2>Scaffolding Computer Science</h2>
                    <p>Computer Science – Programming in C# was an introductory computer programming class for many
                        students. The students had varying levels of background. Half the class was designated Highly
                        Capable; many of those had previous coding experience and many were driven to learn. Many had
                        no coding experience and needed extra help. Two had cognitive difficulties and needed
                        scaffolding.
                    </p>
                    <p>To begin a unit, I did a code-along demonstration of a particular concept or set of concepts.
                        Students could observe the code displayed on screen as I wrote it and were invited to “code
                        along”. I went slowly, talking about the concept as I did, and allowing the class to direct me
                        as to whether they needed time to catch up. After completion, the demo code I wrote would be
                        made available to the students, as well as the code they were expected to have written with me.
                        They were then given an assignment that was similar to the demo but different enough to require
                        them to apply the concepts to a new context.</p>
                    <p>While the students worked on their assignment, I made the rounds, paying special attention to the
                        students who normally needed help, but also checking in with the others and being open to
                        questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Students were also encouraged to help each other, and several students had “go-to” people they
                        went to for help.</p>
                    <p>For the students who had cognitive difficulties, I would pull up a chair and talk them through
                        the assignment. Usually the demo code was close enough for them to copy/paste or to follow the
                        pattern for the new context. I would sometimes spend 20-25% of the assignment time with them,
                        but it was also surprising to me how much they could accomplish on their own.</p>
                    <p>In retrospect, I wish I had put more comments in my code while I was writing it to serve as
                        directions for students. That would have encouraged them to enter such comments in their code as
                        they coded along, which would help them completing their assignment. It is also a good habit to
                        develop in general.</p>

                <h2>Music Man</h2>
                <p>One student in C# was quite frequently not working on the assignment, but rather something for
                    music class. When I pointed out that he needs to be doing work for us, he usually argued that he
                    can do the C# assignment at home, but &ldquo;this is due today&rdquo;. When I insist, he
                    complies, but usually with some grumbling under his breath and a pissed-off expression. What I
                    see him doing is composing music, and it appears to be quite advanced. Obviously this is
                    something he&rsquo;s really into.</p>
                <p>But I took a different tack one day. I said, &ldquo;You seem to really be into music. You know,
                    you could look to do programming assignments related to music. Digital music techniques are huge
                    now. I&rsquo;m a musician, too, and one program I&rsquo;d like to have is a way to replace a
                    music binder with an iPad containing the performance list tied to the conductor&rsquo;s iPad as
                    to a server, so that when she changes a page everyone&rsquo;s page changes, and when she brings
                    up a new piece we all get it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>He was shocked. You&rsquo;re a musician? Yes, I told him. I played French Horn, Baritone,
                    Clarinet, and Bass Clarinet in high school, and I was in choir and vocal ensemble, and took
                    voice lessons for four years. I&rsquo;ve sung in three church choirs and I sing now in the
                    Orthodox Church. And I delivered singing telegrams for Rhymes, Chimes, and Gorillas when I was
                    in college. It was like he was looking at me for the first time. He called another boy in the
                    band. &ldquo;Hey, Mr. Malkasian&rsquo;s a musician!&rdquo; We chatted a bit, I asked about their
                    next concert. It was amazing to so quickly make a connection and see a complete turn-around in
                    attitude. I was able to attend their Spring concert, which featured music he composed.</p>
                <p>As with all the other students, he was assigned to a &ldquo;Hunt the Wumpus&rdquo; team for the
                    game-building competition sponsored by Microsoft. I suggested that after he completed his
                    assigned component, he could also create the music for his team&rsquo;s game. He worked
                    incredibly hard, the game sounded great, and suddenly all the teams were implementing sound
                    tracks. And his team won a trophy.</p>

                <h2>Adding Challenge</h2>
                <p>A significant number of students in my programming classes were highly capable and highly
                    motivated. The goal was to keep their interest and provide challenging learning opportunities
                    while not overwhelming those who need more help.</p>
                <p>My solution was to begin each lesson simply with what the students already knew, adding more to
                    it until we reached the learning objectives. I taught theory first but then moved right into
                    demonstrating how to write the code. The students who needed minimal instruction could jump
                    right into doing the assignment without waiting for me to finish the lesson. While I was doing
                    this, I threw out teasers by mentioning a coding technique that would solve a more complex
                    problem that I could show them “later”, just to pique interest. Then as I did my rounds I would
                    stop at the desks of hi-cap students and say, “hey, want to see something?” and show them the
                    more advanced technique.</p>
                <p>But these extra lessons were not only offered to the students designated hi-cap. Often, while
                    working 1:1 with a struggling student, if things were connecting for them then along with my 1:1
                    recitation of the theory I’d elaborate a bit more and show them the technique, too. This made
                    them feel special, recipients of the secret knowledge. Other students weren’t ready for it or
                    not interested, and that was fine because it wasn’t required for the assignment.</p>
                <p>Another strategy was to add a “Challenge” problem to an assignment. It wasn’t required, but it
                    could earn extra points.</p>
