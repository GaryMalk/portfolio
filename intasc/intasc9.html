            <blockquote class="italics">The candidate engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to
                continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others
                (learners, families, other professionals, and the community), and adapts practice to meet the needs of
                each learner.</blockquote>

            <p>The essence of this standard is continuous improvement: on-going self-reflection, seeking out feedback
                and constructive feedback, being dedicated to on-going development of my skills as a teacher and in my
                content areas of computer science and mathematics, and keeping abreast of new developments. I also want
                to be sensitive in my interactions in our community of learners, both with students and teachers, and to
                adapt my methods to meet the needs of others.</p>
            <p>My artifacts for this are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My Professional Growth Plan, which I shared with my host-school mentor and with my field supervisor.
                    Areas identified for growth were aligned with Learner Development. I am particularly interested in
                    ELL students and how I can better meet their needs. In computer science and mathematics are
                    international; there are many learning resources that can help on the internet. Mathematics and
                    computer programming are both in a real sense languages, so the ELL has skills to draw on to do
                    that. I want to learn better how to assist that process. I also want to continually keep my own
                    technical skills up to date.</li>
                <li>National IT Innovation Center (NITIC) Summer 2024 Working Connections: Cyber Buffet Certificate of
                    Completion. This was a week-long seminar for college computer science instructors. The track I
                    attended was Cyber Buffet, where we learned how to detect and combat computer viruses. The class
                    provided tools to use for developing our own classes to teach it.</li>
