            <blockquote class="italics">The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures
                of the discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make the discipline
                accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content.</blockquote>

            <p>This standard is self-explanitory: I'm expected to be an expert in the content I teach. I demonstrate my
                knowledge and skills through lectures that are comprehensible and expand a student's knowledge,
                easy-to-follow demonstrations, answering questions, and mentoring students.</p>
            <p>My field is computer science, so just as important is transmitting the skill to seek out knowledge and
                apply it. IT moves so fast that no one can possibly know it all - certainly not me - so beyond the
                basics, the real skill needed in industry isn't what you know but how fast you can learn. I transmit
                this skill by honestly answering, when appropriate, "I don't know, let's find out" and assisting a
                student researching a topic or technique.</p>
            <p>Artifacts I've created that demonstrate my content knowledge:</p>

            <h2>Websites</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>This very website!</em> I teach HTML and this portfolio website was written manually, not with a
                    tool.
                    I'm teaching it now, Summer 2025, as I'm creating this portfolio. My students are required to create
                    a website as their final project for the quarter, so it's been fun to show them my final project as
                    I'm creating it. My students have access to the source code: <a
                        href="https://github.com/GaryMalk/portfolio"
                        rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/GaryMalk/portfolio</a>&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The CS Toolkit I created as an assignment for the CWU MAT tech class: <a
                        href="https://garymalk.github.io/CSToolkit"
                        rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://garymalk.github.io/CSToolkit</a>. Again, written by hand, with special
                    care to make the whole site demonstrable of the coding techniques I teach my students in the HTML
                    class. Students have access to the source code: <a href="https://github.com/GaryMalk/CSD112"
                        rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/GaryMalk/CSD112</a></li>
