                <h2>Formative Assessments</h2>
                <p>As an instructor, I assist students with feedback as they are working as well as solicit feedback
                    while I'm teaching. I encourage students to evaluate themselves by providing tools and opportunities
                    to critique each other. Artifacts which demonstrate my use of formative assessment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fist of Five: this screenshot is inserted at multiple points in a lecture presentation. Students
                        are asked, as a group, to raise their hands in the air with a number of fingers displayed
                        indicating their confidence in the material presented so far. When I see students displaying 0-3
                        fingers, I stop and probe for what the point of confusion is. When possible, I'll ask a student
                        displaying 4 or 5 if they can explain it. Sometimes hearing it from another student makes all
                        the difference.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>Mud Check: asking a yes/no question such as "did everyone understand that" or "are there any
                        questions" will not always get results because sometimes a confused student is afraid of looking
                        stupid. "What is the Muddiest thing I said today" or "what was the most confusing concept for
                        you?" is open ended and&nbsp;<em>presumes</em> that something was confusing which makes it safer
                        for the student to bring something up.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I ask both questions verbally when not using presentation software.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box intasc">
                <ul>
                    <li>Online HTML and CSS validator tools: My HTML students are required to use these on their
                        assignments before turning them in, which makes them formative self-assessment. However, I will
                        use these tools, too, and if I find any errors the tools immediately become summative! We have
                        weekly assignments, so getting points knocked off a previous one is usually, again, a formative
                        experience. There are many online valiator tools, but these are my favorites:
                        <br><a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML Validator</a>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS
                            Validator</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students give each other feedback, such as critiquing each other's <a
                            href="intasc5.html#projects" target="_self">Final Projects</a> as displayed in Standard #4..
                    </li>
                    <li>"Do Now" Quizzes: In order to make sure my students are reading the
                        textbook&nbsp;<em>before</em> the
                        lecture, they have a short, low-stakes, open-book quiz at the beginning of class before I've
                        even lectured on the material. It is partly summative because it does contribute to their grade,
                        but the points are low, I will go over the correct answers in the lecture, and students in the
                        lower division classes can take the quiz a second time, so it's mostly formative.</li>
                    <li>Scholarship Essay - written feedback: This was part of the Paying for College unit in the
                        Personal Finance class. I present as artifacts the student's initial submission, my feedback,
                        and the student's final submission.</li>

                <h2>Scholarship Rough Draft</h2>
                <p>Most days, the house is loud. Not with laughter or music, but with the sounds of crying toddlers,
                    parents yelling, and the aching reminder of responsibility. I’m the oldest of three, and while most
                    people my age were worrying about what to post, I was figuring out how to clean the whole house,
                    babysit, work, and get my homework done all in the same day.</p>
                <p>
                    My mom is a hard worker, she’s worked at the same place for as long as I can remeber, 40 hour weeks,
                    sometimes 60. My dad, I don’t even really know. He’s always been in my life but he’s never really
                    been there. An empty shell where a man once was. Silent car rides, birthday cards that all say the
                    same thing. They always say we’re working on things but nothing has ever changed. For aslong as I
                    can remember, my grandfather has been my bestfriend. I used to go to his house every summer and
                    every week or weekend if my parents allowed. He would always tell me his crazy stories while we’d
                    work in the yard and work on all these different projects. I didn’t talk to many people in my life
                    about what was going on with me. A lot of people wouldn’t even understand. He understood me though,
                    he saw the best in everyone. When he passed away a few months ago, I felt like a piece of me had
                    died too. In my darkest days he was what got me through, even now I still do my best for him.

                <h2>Scholarship Rough Draft Feedback</h2>
                <p>Great start, with a moving emotional narrative. A few things:</p>
                <p>You've got the vulnerability piece nailed. Now you have to figure out where you are going with this.
                    How is this related to your educational goals and what you want to do with your life? What insights
                    do you have?</p>
                <p>Some crafting issues:<br />"My mom is a hard worker, she&rsquo;s worked at..."<br />Those are two
                    independent clauses. They can't be joined by a comma. I would change the first part into its own
                    sentence:<br />"My mom is a hard worker. She&rsquo;s worked at..."</p>
                <p>"remeber" - spelling: remember</p>
                <p>"An empty shell where a man once was." I get your meaning, but that's a judgement. I would leave it
                    out and stick to the facts such as silent car rides, repetitive birthday cards, and not being there.
                </p>
                <p>"For aslong as I can remember, my grandfather has been my bestfriend." I would make this the start of
                    a new paragraph, because it is a change of subject from your mom and dad. Also:</p>
                <p>"aslong" that's two words: "as long"</p>
                <p>"bestfriend" also two words</p>
                <p>"In my darkest days he was what got me through, even now I still do my best for him."</p>
                <p>Again, you have two independent clauses joined by a comma. It's much stronger like this:<br />"In my
                    darkest days he was what got me through. Even now I still do my best for him."</p>
                <p>Use grammar check &amp; spell check, and ask at least three people to critique it for you. One of
                    those people should be an English teacher and one should be another student.</p>
                <p>Great start, though. You communicate your feelings very well. Tie it in with what you have learned
                    and what you want to do and it will be a strong contender.<br />Thu May 29, 2025 at 12:12 pm</p>

                <p>For as long as I can remember, my grandfather has been my best friend. I used to go to his house
                    every summer and every week or weekend if my parents allowed. He would always tell me his crazy

                    ago, I felt like a piece of me had died too. In my darkest days he was what got me through. Even now
                    I still do my best for him.</p>
                <p>I taught myself to be a parent and a student at the same time, helping my siblings with their
                    homework while I did my own, getting stuff done early when the house was quiet. School was where I
                    could escape. The pages of my books didn&rsquo;t judge me. The teachers didn&rsquo;t complain when I
                    was too tired to speak, and sometimes just being in a classroom was enough to gain strength from
                    learning, maybe something I learned from my grandpa since he was a life long learner.</p>
                <p>Everyday I think about quitting. The day I broke my back and shoulders I literally thought I might
                    never recover. The only place I had joy was with football. I wanted to quit. I stayed in school
                    while recovering, and stayed on top of schoolwork. I feared that if I did not keep my word, I would
                    never change the narrative of my life days when grief forced me to carry a weight I could not lift.
                    But I keep coming back because I believe in education. I believe in where it might take me, and most
                    importantly I believe in where it might take my family.</p>
                <p>I&rsquo;m not entering college as an escape, and I&rsquo;m not on a mission to get a degree. I want
                    to study psychology and become a person who helps others overcome circumstances. I want to show my
                    siblings that the beginning doesn&rsquo;t dictate the ending, and remind the young boy I once
                    was&mdash;all cozied up on a couch with a flashlight and a book&mdash;that he was always meant to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>I've learned that strength is not always loud. Sometimes, strength looks like getting up early enough
                    before the sun even comes up to make everyone lunches. Sometimes it looks like studying in the
                    morning when it&rsquo;s finally quiet. Sometimes I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m strong at all but I
                    know that some day it will all be worth it. I have the weight of my family's hope on my shoulders
                    and I carry it with pride.</p>
                <p>This scholarship would not be just a financial burden relieved, but it would be a doorway. A way to
                    turn pain into purpose, because then it would all be for something. A way to make my grandfather
                    proud, repay my mother of all her sacrifices, and to be the role model and example for my siblings.
                </p>
                <p>I am not looking for an easy path, I have never had one. I am just looking to keep moving forward.

                    <li>History of Computer Science Exit Ticket: the student demonstrates that they mastered the

                        on the internet, but this mock has questions similar to or from the same test bank as the real
                        exam but with the numbers changed. Students can take the mock as many times as they like, but it
                        is work no points. It is in that sense a formative assessment but an example of what the

                    <li>Final Exam Item Banks: the Algorithms final exam is 25 questions, online, in-person, on school
                        computers only with internet access limited to Canvas and the online course textbook. The
                        questions are randomly taken from the banks per the break-down. Question order is randomized and
                        answer choices are randomized.</li>
